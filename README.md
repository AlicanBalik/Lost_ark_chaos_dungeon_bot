# Lost_ark_chaos_dungeon_bot
Lost ark bot to farm chaos dungeons.

Character need to be close to Chaos Dungeon statue. In images you need to place image of every spell you want to use named as hotkey which is assigned to it. In spells.py you need to set which spells you want to use also. Then start main.py and let the magic work.

I used a lot libraries like pyautogui to manage all actions and locate images on screen, cv2 to manipulate screen of minimap to find right way to ally, scale it to normal size and move. Mss to speed up screenshot function. Few more popular libraries like random, time, Image etc.

Bot work for every class in game but first is needed to configure spells.py
